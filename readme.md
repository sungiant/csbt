This repository contains the source for `csbt`, a super simple C# build tool.  Right now this project is essentially a proof of concept.

`csbt` was inspired by the simplicty of the original .NET Core build tool that enabled developers to define projects and solutions exculsively with simple JSON files.

`csbt` currently supports the following operations:

  * defining projects and solutions with simple json files.
  * compilation of solutions using mcs.
  * `t4` text transform pre processing.
  * external dependencies via `nuget` and/or local packages.
  * Visual Studio project and solution generation.
